This is a fork of [VoxelSniper](https://github.com/TVPT/VoxelSniper). It adds support for newer versions of [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [Paper](https://papermc.io/) keeping available all features from original version of plugin, but with optimizations and code cleanup.

### What is FAVS and why should I use it?

FAVS is designed for efficient terrain creation.

- VoxelSniper is the premier long range map editing tool for Minecraft. This mod allows you to edit any block that you can see using an arrow (for replacing) and a gunpowder (for adding).
- It is best used by those with a strong attention to detail and 
  fits a wide array of applications, from making detailed edits to structures with the snipe brush, to making massive terraforming jobs a breeze with some of the earth shattering soft selection tools.
- FastAsyncVoxelSniper allows you to perform operations asynchronously, so you can let a lot of people perform many voxel 
  operations with ease and not hanging your server.
- Simple to setup and use
- Extremely configurable
- Uses minimal CPU/Memory
- Safe for many players to use
- Insanely fast, when using the slowest mode
- Hooks into FAWE to utilize its async features and respects the same protection plugins like FAWE.
