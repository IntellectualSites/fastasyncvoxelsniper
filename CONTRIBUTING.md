# Contributing
If you feel like you can improve the plugin any way, then you are more than welcome to contribute to FastAsyncVoxelSniper. It 
would be highly appreciated if you made sure to test your code before committing it, as it will save us a lot of time and effort.

### Code Style
If you are planning to commit any changes to the project, it would be highly appreciated if you were to follow the project
code style conventions. To make this easier we have provided settings that can be picked up by your IDE.

IntelliJ: Install the `EditorConfig` plugin. Now IntelliJ is able to pick up the provided `.editorconfig` file automatically.
